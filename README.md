A Verilog compiler for Minecraft

Why?
----
A better question is, why not?

If you need a better answer than that, then you're not really the target audience of this project. That said, if we get this project off the ground, it will make it exponentially easier to build complicated redstone circuits in Minecraft. Imagine writing some Verilog and running it through a compiler and having a working redstone circuit, rather than spending countless hours building it manually in Minecraft.
